# AWS EC2 ICMP Ping Utility

## Description

This Go program is designed to identify active (ICMP responsive) EC2 instances in AWS. It fetches the current IP ranges allocated for EC2 services from AWS, sends ICMP Echo Requests to these IPs, and records the IPs that respond. This utility is particularly useful to find responsiveness of EC2 instances.

## Key Features

- **ICMP Echo Request Sender**: Sends ICMP Echo Requests to a list of IP addresses within the specified AWS EC2 IP ranges. As defined by AWS https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json
- **Active Instance Detection**: Identifies active EC2 instances by recording the IPs that respond to the ICMP Echo Requests.
- **Configurable Rate Limit**: The rate of ICMP requests can be configured, allowing control over network traffic generated by the utility.
- **Results Logging**: The IPs that respond are logged into a file, providing a record of all active instances detected during the program's run.

## How to Run

To run this program, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Ensure you have Go installed on your system. You can download and install Go from [here](https://golang.org/dl/).
   - Internet access is required for the program to fetch AWS IP ranges and to send ICMP requests.

2. **Setting the Rate Limit**:
   - The default rate limit is set to 20,000 ICMP Echo Requests per second.
   - You can configure the rate limit by modifying the `ratelimit` variable in the code.

3. **Running the Program**:
   - Compile the program using `go build -o ping-aws-ips`.
   - Run the compiled binary. For example: `./aws-ec2-icmp-ping`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program will print the responding IPs to a file named `ping_results_<timestamp>.txt`.
   - The `<timestamp>` in the filename ensures that each run generates a unique file.

5. **Interrupt Handling**:
   - If the program is interrupted (e.g., via Ctrl-C), it will still finalize and write the results to the output file before exiting.
